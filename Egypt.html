                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <p>2 Teblespoons ghee
                            <br>1/2 Tablespoon crushed garlic
                            <br>3/2 Tablespoon dry coriander
                            <br>1 cube chicken bouillon
                            <br>2-3 cups chicken broth
                            <br>1/4 teaspoon baking soaked
                            <br>2 Tablespoon to 1/4 cup tomato sauce
                            <br>1 (400g) package of frozen Molokhia
                            <br>Salt to taste 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="2">
                        <h3>instructions</h3>
                        <p>
                            In a deep pot over medium-high heat melt ghee then sauté garlic for 15-30 seconds until lightly golden and fragrant.
                            <br>Add coriander and keep stirring for another 30 seconds.
                            <br>Pour in one and half cups broth and sprinkle the bouillon cube.
                            <br>Stir everything together until bouillon is dissolved. Stir in the baking soda if using.
                            <br>Add the Molokhia, and turn down the heat to medium low,. Using a whisk stir until the Molokhia has melted completely in the broth.
                            <br>Pour in the tomato sauce and still well.
                            <br>Check consistency of the Molokhia, It is going to be thick. If you like it that way then do not add any more broth but if you want it thinner then add broth until you reach the consistency you love.
                            <br>Now Check the taste if you need more sweetness and tartness add more tomato sauce. If it needs more salt add salt to your liking.
                            <br>Continue cooking Molokhia until the leaves are cooked and does not taste raw anymore.
                            <br>Molokhia is usually done when it just starts boiling all over on low heat.
                            <br>Do not cover Molokhia immediately, let it cool down completely before covering or serve directly with rice, chicken and pita bread.

                        <h3>Notes</h3>
                        <p>
                            I love using ghee when making Molokhia. You can use butter or  oil as well
                            <br>For a complete vegan Molokhia, use olive oil, vegetable broth and bouillon. Boillion is added for more flavor, if you do not have it or do not feel like using it feel free to skip.
                            <br>Do not add the baking soda if you usually do not have leftovers, there is no need to.
                        </p>

                    <div class="1">
                        <h3>Hawawshi seasoning</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s not a hawawshi sandwich without the unique seasoning or spice mixture of coriander, allspice, paprika, black pepper, cumin, cardamom, and a pinch of cinnamon (find these spices and more at our online shop).
                            
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="2">
                        <h3>The meat mixture</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lean ground beef combinedwith finely chopped vegetables including garlic, onion, bell paper, hot pepper like jalapeno(optional), and finaly chopped parsley. The hawawshi seasoning is added to this mixture and combined before cooking
                             (Kinda like how you would prepare meat for meatballs, exept in the case you do not form the meat into balls).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="3">
                        <h3>Pita pockets</h3>
                        <p>Like i mentioned earlier, this is the shortcut version which uses already available pita pockets. The seasoned meat mixture is spread in the pita pockets and then baked until the meat is fully cooked through. 
                            It will take about 25 minutes or so in a 400 degrees F heated oven.
                            <br>
                            The key is to cock the pita on both sides so it's nice and crispy.
                        </p>

                    <div class="4">
                        <h3>How to serve it?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This satisfying sandwich is typically served hot without much elese to accompany it, but, i like adding some sliced veggies or quick pickles and a side of tahini sauce
                            (which is awesome drizzled in the sandwich). And it's never a bad idea to add a big salad like this lazy Mediterranean salad, fresh bean salad, or even Greeek salad.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="5">
                        <h3>Leftovers & storage</h3>
                        <p>
                            This recipe makes 12pita pockets, so you can easily feed a crowd of at least 6 people. But, i often make it for out little family of four and save the leftovers in the fridge for lunches.
