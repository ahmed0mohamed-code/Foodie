                            <h3>How to make Hummus</h3>
                            <p>
                                Whip the tahini and lemon juice first. Add the tahini and lemon juice to your food processor, then, before you add anything else, turn it on and let it run for a minute or two.
                                <br><br>
                                Tip 2: Add the chickpeas in two batches. Once you have the whipped tahini and lemon, you can add the remaining hummus ingredients. I like adding the chickpeas in two batches, processing the first batch for a minute before adding the rest. Then, I stand back and let my food processor run.
                                <br><br>
                                Tip 3: Add a little liquid at the end. When it looks close to done, I add a splash of cold water while the processor is still running. After a few tablespoons of water, the mixture transforms into fluffy, creamy, whipped hummus.
                                <br><br>
                                Tip 4: Do you need to peel the chickpeas? I usually skip peeling my chickpeas when making hummus, but it’s totally up to you! If you have some extra time and want the absolute smoothest texture, go ahead and peel them. It takes about 10 minutes to peel a can of chickpeas, and it does make a subtle difference.

                                Salt your tomato and cucumber, and drain off the excess juice. Fortunately, this doesn’t take any extra time. Tomato and cucumber release a lot of moisture when they’re exposed to salt, and will make your tabbouleh way too watery if you do not drain it off.
                                <br>Simply combine the tomato and cucumber in a bowl with some salt (you’ll find these instructions in the recipe below), and set it aside while you chop the parsley. Drain off the excess juice before you stir the salad together. Easy!
                                <br><br>
                                Use lots of parsley and chop it finely. This recipe calls for three bunches of parsley, and the easiest way to chop that much parsley is in your food processor. You can do it by hand, but it will take a while. Don’t worry about removing the thin parsley stems—they offer a lot of great flavor.
                                <br><br>
                                Season sufficiently with lemon juice and salt.
Tabbouleh should be zingy and full of flavor, and you’ll need to use enough lemon and salt to get there.
