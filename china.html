                                Since the chicken needs to marinate for 15 minutes, get that started first. In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, dry sherry, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                                <br><br>
                                Meanwhile, chop the bell pepper, celery, scallions, and garlic. With stir-fries, having all your ingredients prepped beforehand is crucial because the cooking process is quick and leaves no time for chopping as you go!
                                <br><br>
                                In another medium bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together all of the sauce ingredients: balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, ground ginger, and water.
                                <br><br>
                                Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil to the pan, then add the bell pepper, celery, and salt. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the veggies are slightly softened and starting to brown. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl and set aside.
                                <br><br>
                                Add another half tablespoon of oil to the pan and crank up the heat. Toss in half the chicken—just be sure not to crowd the pan—and let it brown on one side.
                                <br><br>
                                Flip the chicken pieces and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, just until they’re cooked through. Transfer them to the bowl with the peppers and celery. Add another half tablespoon of oil to the pan, then cook the remaining chicken until golden on one side. Turn the chicken pieces over and cook for 1 minute. Add a bit more oil to the pan, along with the garlic and scallions.
                                <br><br>
                                Cook for about 30 seconds. Then add the reserved vegetables, chicken, and sauce to the pan.
                                <br><br>
                                Reduce the heat to low and cook for about 30 seconds, until the chicken and vegetables are warmed through and the sauce has thickened, and then stir in the nuts.

                            <p>
                                If duck was frozen, make sure it is completely thawed. Pat dry.
                                <br><br>
                                Make honey sauce. Combine water, honey, lemon slices, soy sauce, and rice wine; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep sauce hot.
                                <br><br>
                                Take a meat hook and put through the neck part of the duck. Hold the meat hook, and dip the duck into the hot honey sauce. Let drip a few minutes, and dunk the duck again. Then over a baking dish, spoon the rest of the hot honey sauce over the duck, making sure to cover the duck completely. Continue to baste the duck until you've used all the liquid in the pan.
                                <br><br>
                                Hang the duck in a cool, dry well-ventilated place with a bowl beneath to catch any drips. Let the duck dry for five hours or overnight. Note: If you don't have a place with great air circulation, dry the duck in an unheated room with a fan blowing on it.
                                <br><br>
                                After drying the duck, the skin will be very tight and dry to the touch. Remove the hook. Place the duck, breast side up on an oiled rack, so air can flow around the duck while it's cooking. Place the rack in a roasting pan that has 2-3 inches of water in it, so the fat can drip into the water and not splatter in your oven or on the duck.
                                <br><br>
                                Place the pan in a 475 degree F oven and roast for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 degrees F and continue roasting for another 1 hour, 10 minutes more. If you like, turn the breast meat side down about 30 minutes into roasting. When done, remove from oven and let sit 15 minutes.
                                <br><br>
                                While the duck is cooking, make scallion brushes. Trim off the roots and the top green part, leaving about a 4 inch piece. Make 1 inch lengthwise slits into the white end of each to create a brush. Put in ice water for 20 minutes. Drain, then refrigerate.
                                <br><br>
                                Carve the duck and separate the meat and the skin. To serve, use the scallions to brush hoisin sauce on the pancakes. Add duck skin, meat and scallion. Fold one end over and roll up.

                                Have a pot of soup simmering on stove. (Dumplings cook in soup or gravy.)
                                <br><br>
                                In medium bowl mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper until well blended. Add optional herbs if using. Create well in center.
                                <br><br>
                                In small bowl, mix milk and butter.

                                Add wet ingredients to dry, mix until well combined, but avoid over-mixing. Batter will be thick and a bit sticky.

                                Use heaping teaspoons to form balls and place on parchment paper. Allow dumplings to set 5 minutes.

                                Reduce heat under soup to low simmer. Drop dumplings into soup and cover. Do not lift lid. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Enjoy!
