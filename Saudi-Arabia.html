                                Make spice mix: Stir together saffron, cinnamon, allspice, lime powder, cardamom, and white pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
                                <br><br>
                                Make dish: Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in butter until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato purée.
                                <br><br>
                                Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, carrots, cloves, nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and reserved spice mix. Cook for about 3 minutes; pour in water and add chicken bouillon cube.
                                <br><br>
                                Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat, and cover the pot. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
                                <br><br>
                                Gently stir in rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and almost dry, about 25 minutes; add raisins and a little more hot water, if necessary. Cover and cook until rice grains separate, 5 to 10 minutes.
                                <br><br>
                                Transfer rice to a large serving platter and arrange chicken on top. Sprinkle with toasted slivered almonds.

                                Step 1: Add all the stock ingredients to a large saucepan.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 2: Bring to a boil then simmer until chicken cooks through.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 3: Place the chicken from the stock onto a baking pan.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 4: Rub with ghee and sprinkle spices on top, then roast until golden brown.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 5: Add the rice, chicken stock, and water to a large saucepan.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 6: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a low simmer, cover and cook for 30-45 minutes.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 7: Add a splash of liquid if rice is drying out and cook until porridge like.
                                <br><br>
                                Step 8: Add in the milk and cover the pot with a lid and cook for another 10 minutes.

                                <b>Hint</b> Really infuse your chicken stock with flavor, since this is the base of the rice. Once it’s done cooking, taste and adjust seasoning by adding extra salt or spices as desired.

                            <h3>How to serve</h3>
                            <p>
                                Sides -You can serve with daqous, or any spicy sort of salsa, or a fresh green salad like fattoush.
                                <br><br>
                                Jazz it up- If you really want to elevate saleeg, you can try topping with toasted nuts, fresh parsley, and/or crispy or caramelized onions.
                                <br><br>
                                Chicken – You want to use chicken with bones in it to make the broth that the rice is cooked in, but you can go for quartered chicken or chicken pieces if you prefer.
                                <br><br>
                                Ghee – Traditionally you serve this with a little extra ghee drizzled over the top, but you can leave this out or subsitute with olive oil if you prefer.
